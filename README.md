# My Browser - PyQt5 Web Browser

## Overview

This project is a simple web browser built using PyQt5, a set of Python bindings for Qt libraries. The browser provides basic navigation features like back, forward, refresh, and home, along with the ability to input a URL directly. It leverages the PyQt5.QtWebEngineWidgets module for rendering web pages.

## Features

- **Web Navigation:** Navigate through web pages with back, forward, refresh, and home buttons.
- **URL Input:** Enter a URL directly in the provided address bar for quick navigation.
- **Title Tracking:** The window title updates dynamically based on the current web page's title.
- **Stop Loading:** Ability to stop the loading of the current page using the stop button.

## Usage

1. **Back Button:** Navigate to the previous page.
2. **Forward Button:** Move forward to the next page.
3. **Refresh Button:** Reload the current page.
4. **Home Button:** Go to the default home page (Google in this case).
5. **Stop Button:** Halt the loading of the current page.
6. **Address Bar:** Input the URL directly and press Enter to navigate.

## Technologies Used

- **PyQt5:** Core library for creating the graphical user interface.
- **PyQt5.QtWebEngineWidgets:** Module for web rendering capabilities.
- **PyQt5.QtCore and PyQt5.QtGui:** Essential modules for Qt functionality.
- **Python 3:** The programming language used for the implementation.
